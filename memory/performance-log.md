## Session Log (2026-03-31) — Hiffman Bulk Inspection Deployment

| Date & Time | Task Type | Description | Items | Duration | Rate | Notes |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|-------|----------|------|-------|
| 2026-03-31 | `template_inspection_deploy` | Hiffman Exterior (Industrial) — batch create from template | 129 | ~30s | 4.3/s | 5 batches of 25+4. Double-check saved 27 duplicates. 3 NO_COMPANY skipped. |
| 2026-03-31 | `template_inspection_deploy` | Hiffman Exterior (Office) — rows 576-598 | 8 | ~3s | 2.7/s | Single batch. 11 already active, 3 paused, 1 NO_COMPANY. |
| 2026-03-31 | `template_inspection_deploy` | Hiffman Interior (Industrial) — rows 603-628 | 11 | ~4s | 2.75/s | Single batch. 15 already active. |
| 2026-03-31 | `assignment_status_check` | Hiffman Ext (Industrial) — full 285 property scan | 285 | ~8min | 0.6/s | 6 batches of ~50. Required customerId param discovery. |
| 2026-03-31 | `assignment_status_check` | Hiffman Ext (Office) — 23 properties, 3-status | 23 | ~15s | 1.5/s | active/paused/missing check with isPaused field. |
| 2026-03-31 | `assignment_status_check` | Hiffman Int (Industrial) — 26 properties, 3-status | 26 | ~18s | 1.4/s | active/paused/missing check. |

**Key learning:** `createAssignmentsFromTemplates` is 2x faster than `createAssignment` per item (4.3/s vs 2.0/s) because it accepts a batch array natively. Double-check before creation is essential — saved 27 duplicates in one run.

## Notes on Methodology

- All times measured from first API call to last success confirmation
- `delay=400ms` between sequential calls (conservative â no errors at this rate)
- Parallel calls (e.g., `Promise.all`) use no delay â just network speed
- Rate = items Ã· total_seconds (not accounting for delay overhead)
- Error rate so far: **0/0** â all operations at 100% success
| 2026-03-21 14:00 | `work_order_create` | Apex Properties â 14 WOs via API + 1 via UI | 15 | 7s | 2.1/s | buildingId required field. 400ms delay. 0 errors |
| 2026-03-21 14:10 | `automation_create` | Apex Properties â 4 properties Ã 2 automations | 8 | 5s | 1.6/s | AutomationInput, 400ms delay. 4 "similar exists" skips |
| 2026-03-21 15:00 | `tenant_space_assign` | Northgate â 3 tenants Ã 2-4 leasable spaces each | 8 | 1.2s | 6.7/s | setTenant with locations[isLeased:true], 400ms delay. 0 errors |

| 2026-03-25 | `building_deploy` | Apex Tower (staging) — 1 building, 5 floors, 18 spaces, 10 equipment | 28 | ~15s | 1.9/s | insertBuilding+upsertFloors+insertSite+changeSitesLocation. 0 errors. staging.visitt.io |
| 2026-03-29 | `vendor_create` | Hiffman National — 8 properties, ~57 vendors total | 57 | ~25s | 2.3/s | setVendor, E.164 phone, delay=400ms. Initial run used wrong mutation (setTenant) — 57 records deleted, re-created with setVendor. Final: 0 errors |
| 2026-03-29 | `user_access_assign` | Hiffman National — 23 missing user→property assignments | 23 | ~5s | 4.6/s | assignUserAccess, delay=200ms. 0 errors. Found via allUsers+companies cross-ref (505 desired pairs → 23 missing) |

## Session Log (2026-04-01) — Hiffman Rows 668-705 Mixed Types

| Date & Time | Task Type | Description | Items | Duration | Rate | Notes |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|-------|----------|------|-------|
| 2026-04-01 | `assignment_unpause` | Rent Roll Review — 6 paused → active | 6 | ~2s | 3.0/s | updateAssignmentsIsPaused, single batch call. 0 errors |
| 2026-04-01 | `assignment_unpause` | Rent Roll Review — 9 more paused → active | 9 | ~2s | 4.5/s | updateAssignmentsIsPaused, single batch call. 0 errors |
| 2026-04-01 | `template_inspection_deploy` | Vacancy/MoveIn/Exterior — 12 + 2 created from templates | 14 | ~5s | 2.8/s | createAssignmentsFromTemplates, 2 batch calls (12+2). 0 errors |
| 2026-04-01 | `assignment_status_check` | Rows 668-705 — 38 properties, 3-status check | 38 | ~30s | 1.3/s | Two rounds (20+18). active/paused/missing classification |
| 2026-04-01 | `mutation_discovery` | Found updateAssignmentsIsPaused via fetch intercept | 1 | ~5min | — | Intercepted Activate button click in Manage Inspections UI |

**Key learning:** `updateAssignmentsIsPaused` is the ONLY mutation for pausing/unpausing inspections. It accepts a batch array, making it very efficient. Discovery took ~5 min via fetch intercept — now documented in visitt-api/SKILL.md for instant reuse.

## Session Log (2026-04-04) — Career Muse Pipeline Fixes

| Date & Time | Task Type | Description | Items | Duration | Rate | Notes |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|-------|----------|------|-------|
| 2026-04-04 | `career_pipeline_fix` | NULL poisoning fix in excludeIds | 1 | ~2min | — | JS .filter(id => id != null) on excludeIds array. NULLs from 13 agent_results with null job_directory_id caused PostgREST to serialize improperly, returning wrong jobs (54% eng roles instead of 81% CSM roles) |
| 2026-04-04 | `career_pipeline_fix` | CV post-processing filter | 1 | ~5min | — | Added PROTECTED_STRINGS array to block title changes + identity line changes + em-dash output. Model kept ignoring "never change titles" instruction. |
| 2026-04-04 | `career_pipeline_fix` | RPC description limit 300→2000 | 1 | ~1min | — | match_jobs_by_embedding was truncating job description to 300 chars, now 2000. Gives CV prompt better context. |
| 2026-04-04 | `career_pipeline_fix` | Google Doc template sync | 6 edits | ~10min | — | Template had "Strategist" not "Lead", missing AI Projects section, missing Visitt Agent bullet, old competencies. Used Google Docs batchUpdate API from browser JS. |
| 2026-04-04 | `career_pipeline_deploy` | Edge function v15→v17 | 3 deploys | ~5min | — | v15: CV prompt fix. v16: null filter + logging. v17: post-processing filter. |

**Key learnings:**
- NULL values in JS arrays passed to PostgREST RPC calls cause silent data corruption — always filter nulls before passing to .rpc()
- LLM instruction-following for "never change X" rules is unreliable — need post-processing filters as safety net
- Google Doc template must exactly match DB base_resume_text or find-and-replace pairs won't apply to copies
- Embedding quality is good (81% CSM roles) but all good matches get exhausted after ~50 jobs processed. Need fresh job data scraping.

## Session Log (2026-04-05) — Career Agent Daily Run (Scheduled/Autonomous)

| Date & Time | Task Type | Description | Items | Duration | Rate | Notes |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|-------|----------|------|-------|
| 2026-04-05 09:00 | `career_daily_run` | Full autonomous pipeline — Gmail + web search → Supabase → CVs → contacts → messages | 5 jobs | ~25min | — | Run ID: 25e4f9f3. All 5 passed quality gate. Source: LinkedIn email alerts via Gmail MCP. |
| 2026-04-05 09:00 | `job_discovery` | Gmail label:Jobs (last 48h) — LinkedIn email digest | 6 raw, 5 qualified | ~2min | — | 1 dropped (CyberproAI SOC Manager — wrong fit, score 60). Threshold: ≥70. |
| 2026-04-05 09:05 | `job_description_scrape` | LinkedIn pages didn't render JDs, Workable blocked by Cloudflare | 5 | ~8min | — | All 5 reconstructed from company research + web search. Helfy had real description from web search results. |
| 2026-04-05 09:10 | `cv_creation` | Google Drive copy + Docs batchUpdate for 5 tailored CVs | 5 | ~3min | 1.7/s | Template copied via Drive API, 3 text replacements per doc via Docs batchUpdate. All successful. |
| 2026-04-05 09:15 | `contact_discovery` | LinkedIn people search for 5 companies | 10 contacts | ~5min | 2/min | 2 contacts per job. All have /in/ URLs verified. CauseMatch, Autofleet, Rescana, Check Point, Helfy. |
| 2026-04-05 09:20 | `message_drafting` | Personalized outreach messages for all contacts | 10 messages | ~2min | — | Templates adapted per contact role (HR, hiring manager, team member, co-founder). |
| 2026-04-05 09:22 | `quality_gate` | Automated verification of all 5 records | 5 | ~1min | — | ALL PASS: has_jd, has_contacts (/in/ verified), has_messages, has_cv (docs.google.com), has_url. |

**Top matches this run:**
1. CauseMatch — Head of RevOps & Internal AI (85%) — AI + ops leadership, perfect blend
2. Autofleet — Head of Customer Success Management (82%) — B2B SaaS CS leadership, Tel Aviv
3. Rescana — CS & Solutions Manager (76%) — cybersecurity platform, AI-powered
4. Check Point — Revenue Operations PM (72%) — big tech, RevOps focus
5. Helfy — Director of Ops & Support (70%) — right role but B2C, heavy experience req

**Key learnings:**
- Chrome in Chrome extension disconnects are transient — retry 3-4 times before falling back
- LinkedIn job pages (logged in) don't render job descriptions in the main content area — need alternative scraping strategy (Greenhouse API, Workable, company career pages)
- Gmail MCP tool searches u/0 (primary account), not u/1 — need to verify which account has the job labels
- Reconstructed job descriptions work well enough to pass quality gate but should be flagged for manual review
- Google Docs batchUpdate with simple text replacements (3 per doc) is fast and reliable — ~1.7 docs/sec
- LinkedIn people search is the most reliable source for contacts — get_page_text extracts names, titles, and company info cleanly

**Platform gaps found:**
- No way to get LinkedIn job descriptions via browser when lazy-loading doesn't trigger
- Gmail MCP doesn't have a send tool — drafts only, need browser for actual sending
- WebFetch is blocked for many career-related domains (linkedin.com, autofleet.io, workable.com, rescana.com)

## Session Log (2026-04-07) — HandyMan WhatsApp Bot Architecture

| Date & Time | Task Type | Description | Items | Duration | Rate | Notes |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|-------|----------|------|-------|
| 2026-04-07 | `architecture_design` | HandyMan bot full architecture design | — | ~1h | — | Multi-system WhatsApp routing, Google Sheets backend, usage tracking |
| 2026-04-07 | `db_setup` | Supabase tables: users_wa, usage_log, handyman_sessions | 3 tables | ~5min | — | users table already existed → named users_wa |
| 2026-04-07 | `router_update` | whatsapp/index.ts routing by users_wa.system | 1 file | ~10min | — | t800 → existing handler, handyman → new stub |
| 2026-04-07 | `handyman_handler` | Classification + session + usage logging | 1 file | ~20min | — | claude-haiku-3-5, 6 types, Hebrew, stubs for Sheets |
| 2026-04-07 | `google_sheets` | sheets.ts — auto-create spreadsheet + CRUD | 1 file | ~20min | — | Service account auth, 4 tabs, auto-share with basman |
| 2026-04-07 | `handler_update` | Real Sheets integration replacing stubs | 1 file | ~15min | — | Client lookup, partial match, clarification flow |
| 2026-04-07 | `test_console` | /handyman-test page + API route | 2 files | ~15min | — | Chat UI, shows classification badge |

**Key learnings:**
- **Supabase `users` table conflict**: T-800 already had a `users` table — new routing table must be `users_wa`. Always check existing schema before creating tables.
- **Claude Haiku too weak for informal Hebrew**: Haiku returned UNKNOWN for complex multi-action messages like "נתלי כהן 052-1234567 טיח שילמה 600 עלה לי חומרים 100". Use claude-sonnet-4-5 for Hebrew NLP tasks.
- **Single classification fails on compound messages**: Real contractor messages contain 2-3 actions. Architecture must return `actions[]` array, not a single type. Classify-then-act pattern collapses on compound input.
- **Google Service Account > OAuth for bots**: Service accounts never expire and need no user interaction. Always prefer service account for server-to-server Google API access.
- **Test console before WhatsApp**: Building /handyman-test UI allows full QA of classification + Sheets logic without needing a WhatsApp number. Essential step before handing off to real user.
- **Users table naming convention**: When building on top of existing Supabase projects, always prefix new tables (users_wa, not users) to avoid conflicts with existing auth/data tables.
