# Optimization Log

Audit trail of session learnings. The real value lives in the updated skill files — this is just a record of what changed and when.

## 2026-03-19 — Initial Setup

**Task**: Set up GitHub backup and cross-session memory architecture

**Changes made**:
- Added GitHub backup (Step 4) to `self-review` skill
- Created `CLAUDE.md` as cross-session context file
- Created this log file
- Synced all plugin files to GitHub repo

**Architecture decisions**:
- `CLAUDE.md` = lean cross-session context, max ~1-2 pages
- Skill files = detailed operational knowledge per domain
- `memory/optimization-log.md` = audit trail only
- GitHub = single source of truth, colleague-ready

**GitHub config**: stored at `/sessions/kind-awesome-mendel/mnt/.claude/github-config.json` (not committed)
